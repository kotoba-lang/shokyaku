;; ## Why embed at all
;;
;; There is no portable `io/resource`. Reading `resources/<path>` relative to
;; the process's working directory is right while this library is the root
;; project and wrong the moment it is a dependency — measured 2026-08-18 in
;; `kotoba-lang/technology`, whose registry came back nil for all 159 of
;; iso3166's assertions because nbb's cwd was iso3166's root, not its own.
;; `test/run_portable.cljs` here is run from `/tmp` for exactly that reason.
;;
;; The EDN file stays the source of truth. The generated namespace is a
;; projection, checked by `--check`, and it is what the library reads — no
;; runtime file access, no cwd assumption, works in a browser.
