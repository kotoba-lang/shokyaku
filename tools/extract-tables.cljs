;; This is the provenance of every number in this library. It exists so that
;; "read from the ordinance" is a command someone else can run, not a claim.
;;
;; ## Two things it does NOT do
;;
;; It does not touch 別表第一, 別表第二 or 別表第四. Their 細目 nests up to
;; three levels and the nesting is marked only by an empty 耐用年数 cell — a
;; visual convention the JSON does not carry. See the README.
;;
;; It does not convert a rate to a double. 〇・三三四 becomes
;; `{:num 334 :scale 1000}`, because ClojureScript has no distinct float type
;; and the value would not round-trip.
;;
;; Exit 2 means THE RUN COULD NOT ANSWER — the fetch failed, or the response
;; had no 別表. That must never look like a clean check.

(defn- life-rows
  "Flat 耐用年数 tables only. Rows carry their 別表 because the same 種類 means
  different assets in different tables — ソフトウエア is 別表第三 general
  software and 別表第六 開発研究用 software.

  Two shapes, distinguished by the HEADER column count:

    種類 | 細目 | 耐用年数   別表第三, 別表第六
    種類 | 耐用年数         別表第五

  ## Why the row is left-padded to the header width

  A cell carried by `rowspan` is represented in TWO different ways in the
  same document, and both appear in the tables read here:

    別表第三  emits an EMPTY column     [   , 細目, 年数]
    別表第六  OMITS the column entirely [ 細目, 年数 ]

  Deciding by the row length alone therefore reads 別表第六 細目 as the 種類
  and its 耐用年数 as the 細目. Deciding by emptiness alone misses the
  omitted case. Both mistakes were made here on 2026-08-18 and both were
  caught only by diffing this output against the previous extraction — never
  by a test, because the resulting table parsed perfectly and simply meant
  something else.

  Collapsed cells are always the LEFTMOST ones, so padding the row on the
  left to the header width makes both representations the same shape, after
  which an empty leading cell means inherit."
